# Aircrack_Automation
Running all simple aircrack-ng commands with one click
ALL OF THIS IS BY A BEGINNER

Some Must haves to run 
- Konsole
- Aircrack-ng

Things to know
- If you plan to use this code for yourself (for whatever reason)
    - Make sure that you set Line 28 & Line 41 to $MON_INTERFACE (will set the code to find out what the wireless device name is) 
    - The Konsole command will not come out pretty so know what your searching for then copy it.
Lastly thank you for looking at this :)
